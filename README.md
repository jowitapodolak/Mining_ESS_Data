# Mining_ESS_Data 
## DataMining-FinalProject

This project was a final assignment of Data Mining course at IT University in Copenhagen. 

We are predicting the political orientation of individuals in the European Union based on the European Social Survey Data (you can find the report and datasets in european-social-survey folder). Find the detailed description in Report.pdf

The ESS is a social survey conducted every two years by the ESS European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ESS ERIC) across 23 European countries. The data for this project was collected in 2016 and 2017 to depict attitudes and values in the respective countries.  

The goal of our project was to find determining factors (features) that influence the political view for left-, middle- or right-most and having a look at country-specific aspects. 

In data analysis and preprocessing we performed dataset reduction and filling in missing values with various techniques (see in report, page 2).
Then we performed exploratory analysis followed by supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.  

We did not find significant correlations between the answers and belonging to the right, the left or centre political view. People’s responses on the political view might be biased - answers might be impacted by some recent events and therefore not completely authentic. One more important factor to take into consideration is that what is ’right’, ’centre’ and ’left’ may vary across different countries, positioning oneself as ”right” in Hungary may be followed by other features than in Sweden.
